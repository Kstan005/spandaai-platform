**Engagement Detection: Research and Model Evaluation**

## **Overview**
Engagement detection in video streams is a complex task requiring accurate facial analysis, head pose estimation, and sometimes even gaze or emotion recognition. The following document presents a structured evaluation of existing repositories and models, outlining their strengths, weaknesses, and technical feasibility for real-time or batch processing applications.

## **Evaluated Repositories**

### **1. Manoj-2702/Engage-Vision**
- **Strengths:**
  - Implements head-pose and gaze estimation.
  - Provides fundamental building blocks for engagement detection.
- **Weaknesses:**
  - No emotion detection module.
  - `requirements.txt` lacks completeness, causing dependency issues.
  - `eye_nose_detector.py` fails to execute without significant modification.
  - `main1.py` attempts to detect eye direction but performs poorly, requiring users to be directly focused on the camera.
- **Technical Notes:**
  - Uses OpenCV and Dlib for face detection.
  - Gaze estimation appears to rely on Haar cascades, which are outdated and less effective than deep learning-based approaches.

### **2. Amogh7joshi/engagement-detection**
- **Strengths:**
  - Detailed model architecture documentation.
  - Includes scripts for model training.
- **Weaknesses:**
  - Not immediately usable without training a model.
  - Pretrained weights are not available.
- **Technical Notes:**
  - Employs CNN-based face detection.
  - Uses LSTMs for temporal engagement modeling.
  - Requires dataset preprocessing, which is not explicitly detailed in the documentation.

### **3. Omidmnezami/Engagement-Recognition**
- **Strengths:**
  - Well-documented with an accompanying research paper.
  - Incorporates deep learning-based engagement recognition.
- **Weaknesses:**
  - Trained model is no longer accessible.
  - Dependency versions are outdated and difficult to resolve.
- **Technical Notes:**
  - Uses a combination of OpenFace features and deep learning models for classification.
  - Requires Python 3.6 or older due to dependency constraints.

### **4. Liviaellen/engagementdetector**
- **Strengths:**
  - Well-documented with modularized code.
  - Pretrained model weights included.
- **Weaknesses:**
  - Gaze detection fails for small faces, making it unsuitable for large-classroom settings or online meeting recordings.
  - Version conflicts with NumPy.
- **Technical Notes:**
  - Uses OpenCV for facial keypoint tracking.
  - Gaze estimation relies on pupil detection, which struggles with lower-resolution faces.

### **5. CopurOnur/Engagement_Detection_OpenFace_Bi-LSTM**
- **Strengths:**
  - Works effectively for engagement classification.
- **Weaknesses:**
  - Requires OpenFace, which is not commercially available.
- **Technical Notes:**
  - Uses OpenFace for feature extraction.
  - Employs a Bi-LSTM model for engagement classification.
  - Can handle temporal dependencies in engagement levels but is not feasible for commercial deployment.

## **Alternative Libraries & Model Evaluations**

### **Serengil - DeepFace**
- **Strengths:**
  - Wraps multiple models for face detection and analysis.
  - Provides pre-trained models.
- **Weaknesses:**
  - No built-in batch processing.
  - Extremely memory-intensive (~13GB GPU RAM per instance).
  - Reloads models for each frame, leading to significant inefficiencies.
- **Technical Notes:**
  - Supports multiple backends (e.g., OpenCV, Dlib, RetinaFace, MTCNN).
  - Uses PyTorch/TensorFlow for inference.
  - High inference latency makes real-time use impractical.

### **RetinaFace (Standalone Usage)**
- **Strengths:**
  - High-accuracy face detection.
  - Performs well on smaller faces.
- **Weaknesses:**
  - Highly version-dependent.
  - GPU acceleration is inconsistent across different setups.
- **Technical Notes:**
  - Implements a single-stage detector using Feature Pyramid Networks (FPN) and a ResNet-50 backbone.
  - Outputs bounding boxes, keypoints, and confidence scores.
  - Two backends: MobileNet0.25 (lightweight) and ResNet-50 (more accurate, but heavier).

### **Elliottzheng/batch-face**
- **Strengths:**
  - Optimized for batch processing.
  - Compatible with newer Python and TensorFlow versions.
  - Improves GPU utilization.
- **Weaknesses:**
  - No built-in engagement detection (only facial analysis).
- **Technical Notes:**
  - Built specifically to optimize RetinaFace batch processing.
  - Ensures efficient GPU memory handling.
  - Supports TensorFlow and PyTorch inference backends.

### **SixDRepNet**
- **Strengths:**
  - State-of-the-art head pose estimation model.
  - Trained on top of ImageNet weights for robust generalization.
- **Technical Notes:**
  - Implements a ResNet-50 backbone followed by an MLP regression head.
  - Predicts pitch, yaw, and roll angles (-90° to 90°).
  - Pretrained weights available and optimized for fast inference.

## **Summary & Recommendations**

### **Best Choices for Face Detection:**
- **RetinaFace (via Elliottzheng/batch-face)** for accurate and efficient detection.
- **Alternative:** DeepFace’s RetinaFace wrapper (if batch inefficiencies can be mitigated).

### **Best Choice for Head Pose Estimation:**
- **SixDRepNet** due to its high accuracy and efficient inference speed.

### **Best Engagement Detection Approaches:**
- **Custom Bi-LSTM Model:** Using RetinaFace + SixDRepNet features with a temporal model (similar to CopurOnur’s Bi-LSTM approach, but without OpenFace).
- **CNN + LSTM Hybrid:** Training a CNN-based feature extractor followed by an LSTM to model temporal engagement patterns.
- **Attention-based Transformer Models:** Experimenting with Vision Transformers (ViTs) for engagement detection, leveraging facial and head pose embeddings.

### **Key Challenges to Address:**
- Ensuring models generalize well to lower-resolution faces.
- Efficient GPU utilization for real-time applications.
- Integrating multiple cues (gaze, facial expression, head pose) into a single engagement metric.
