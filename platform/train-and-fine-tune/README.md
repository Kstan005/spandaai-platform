# Train and Fine-Tune Framework

This framework provides a structured approach for training and fine-tuning machine learning models, ensuring high-quality data preparation, robust testing, and efficient deployment pipelines.

---

## Logical Flow

The framework follows these steps:

1. **Data Annotation**: Annotate datasets using Label Studio.
2. **Data Testing**: Validate data quality using Great Expectations.
3. **Pre-Train Testing**: Validate model architecture and data compatibility before training.
4. **Model Training**: Train ML models using PyTorch or TensorFlow.
5. **Post-Train Testing**: Test trained model behavior using Giskard for vulnerability scanning.
6. **Deployment**: Deploy trained models using Docker/Kubernetes.
7. **Monitoring**: Track model performance and data drift using Prometheus/Grafana.

## Instructions

### How to Fire Up Components
1. **Label Studio (Data Annotation)**:
   - Start Label Studio via Docker:
     ```
     docker run -d -p 8080:8080 labelstudio/label-studio:latest
     ```
   - Access the web interface at `http://localhost:8080` to annotate datasets.

2. **Great Expectations (Data Testing)**:
   - Define expectation suites for your dataset to validate its quality:
     ```
     from great_expectations.data_context import DataContext
     context = DataContext()
     suite = context.create_expectation_suite("my_suite")
     ```

3. **Giskard (Post-Train Testing)**:
   - Use Giskard to test LLMs or other machine learning models for vulnerabilities:
     ```
     from giskard import scan
     scan_report = scan(model)
     ```

4. **PyTorch/TensorFlow (Model Training)**:
   - Train your model with annotated and validated datasets.

5. **Docker/Kubernetes (Deployment)**:
   - Containerize your trained model for deployment:
     ```
     docker build -t my-model .
     docker run -p 5000:5000 my-model
     ```

6. **Prometheus/Grafana (Monitoring)**:
   - Set up monitoring dashboards to track key metrics like accuracy, latency, and drift.

### How to Use in Application Context

1. Annotate datasets with Label Studio and export them in a usable format (e.g., JSON, CSV).
2. Validate the annotated datasets with Great Expectations to ensure they meet quality standards.
3. Write pre-train tests to check model architecture and data compatibility.
4. Train your machine learning model using PyTorch or TensorFlow with validated datasets.
5. Run post-train tests with Giskard to ensure robustness and detect vulnerabilities like hallucinations or prompt injections in LLMs.
6. Deploy the trained model in production using Docker/Kubernetes.
7. Monitor performance metrics with Prometheus/Grafana and retrain as necessary.

### Example Use Case

#### Scenario: Sentiment Analysis Model
1. Annotate text data with sentiment labels (`Positive`, `Negative`, `Neutral`) in Label Studio.
2. Validate the dataset to ensure no missing or invalid labels using Great Expectations.
3. Write pre-train tests to check that:
   - Input shape matches the model's requirements.
   - Labels are correctly mapped to output classes.
4. Train a sentiment analysis model on the annotated dataset using PyTorch.
5. Run post-train tests with Giskard to ensure robustness against adversarial inputs (e.g., typos or synonyms).
6. Deploy the model as a REST API using Docker.
7. Monitor API latency and accuracy over time with Prometheus/Grafana.

### Future Work

1. Add automation scripts for seamless integration of components.
2. Develop a frontend interface for easier interaction with the framework.
3. Integrate active learning workflows for iterative improvements.
